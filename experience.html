				<h2>System Engineer Co-Op</h2>
				<p>
					Assisted implementing Puppet infrastructure with r10k on OpenStack. Specifically helped the 
					full-time system engineers to set up a puppet master server in OpenStack, 
					and configured it to connect with puppet agents. Then helped implement r10k to puppet master, 
					which enables the user to manage puppet modules using Git instead of accessing the puppet master directly.
				</p>
				<p>
					Wrote puppet modules for install/configure Ipsilon server and client. Specifically, the modules
					installed/update the required packages for ipsilon server/client. Then made the module to create/run
					a custom shell script that installs the ipsilon server and client with custom configuration, and
					establish connection between the server/client.
				</p>
				<p>
					Wrote puppet modules for install/configure Request Tracker. The module could installed/update
					the required packages for Request Tracker, and create a custom shell script to install the RT and connects
					to target backend database. The module then enables user to add/edit/remove different Request Tracker 
					and Apache configuration files remotely using puppet r10k management tool, without directly accessing the
					target Request Tracker server.
