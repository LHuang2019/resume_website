				<h2>Undergraduate Research Assistant</h2>
				<p>
					Working under Professor T. M. Murali's Computational Systems Biology research group.
				</p>
				<p>
					Working on the issues posted on <a href="https://github.com/Murali-group/PathLinker-Cytoscape">PathLinker-Cytoscape</a>, 
					using Java with Eclipse and Cytoscape API. Issues including implementing 
					new GUI features, program functionalities, simple view model architecture, creating JUnit tests, fixing bugs, and more. 
				</p>
				<p>
					You can learn more about the PathLinker and the research in general in 
					<a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/6-58/v1">here</a>.

				<h2>Junior Software Engineer</h2>
				<p>
					Debugging and implementing new features on an ongoing development project using C#.
				</p>
				<p>
					Specifically improved the existing designs of the drop-down tree that enables 
					the software to better tracking down the user's selected item tree. 
					Then used these new designs to implement new behaviors for the drop-down tree on user interactions.
				</p>
				<p>
					Added new functions to correctly validate user input on specific values. 
					Also added functions convert these inputs to new values based on different modes, criteria, and validation.

				<h2>System Engineer Co-Op</h2>
				<p>
					Assisted implementing Puppet infrastructure with r10k on OpenStack. Specifically helped the 
					full-time system engineers to set up a puppet master server in OpenStack, 
					and configured it to connect with puppet agents. Then helped implement r10k to puppet master, 
					which enables the user to manage puppet modules using Git instead of accessing the puppet master directly.
				</p>
				<p>
					Wrote puppet modules for install/configure Ipsilon server and client. Specifically, the modules
					installed/update the required packages for ipsilon server/client. Then made the module to create/run
					a custom shell script that installs the ipsilon server and client with custom configuration, and
					establish connection between the server/client.
				</p>
				<p>
					Wrote puppet modules for install/configure Request Tracker. The module could installed/update
					the required packages for Request Tracker, and create a custom shell script to install the RT and connects
					to target backend database. The module then enables user to add/edit/remove different Request Tracker 
					and Apache configuration files remotely using puppet r10k management tool, without directly accessing the
					target Request Tracker server.

				<h2>IT Intern</h2>
				<p>
					Designed and developed on the initial phase of the water plant service report using Microsoft Access, Excel, and VBA.
					Specifically worked on to design a unified service report Excel sheet and its data relationship between the different
					items inside the excel sheet. Used VBA to create different macro and specific GUI to the Excel sheet. Used Microsoft
					Access to worked on databsase relationship. Unfortunately, due to knowledge limitation, was unable to create 
					the data relationship at all, hence the "initial phase". Was able to create a functional excel sheet with specific GUI 
					and different macros to collect user data.
				</p>
				<p>
					Evaluated on various cloud/online backups and remote-control services that best fit the company. 
					Specifically, worked to research through web and talk to customer service with different companies.
					Wrote a small written report to to the IT team to recommend which services best suited the company.
