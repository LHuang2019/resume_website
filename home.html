		<h1>Welcome!</h1>
		<p>
			Hi! my name is Li Jun Huang.
			I am a currently a junior at Virginia Tech with estimated graduation date on Spring 2019.
			I major in Computer Science and minor in Math as well as Cyber Security.
		</p>
		<p>
			I am comfortable with <b>Java</b>, where I have used for most of my school and personal projects in the past years.
			I have work/school experience with <b>C</b>, <b>C#</b> and <b>Puppet</b>, 
			not in-depth, but enough to pick them up again for future work.
			I also have work experience on using <b>Linux terminal</b>, specifically <b> RHEL </b>, 
			<b>OpenStack</b> for creating and managing servers, and <b>Git</b> for basic work flows.
		</p>
		<p>
			I am currently learning <b>Python</b>, <b>SQL</b> and <b>JavaScript</b>, 
			and am planning to use them for future projects.
			I am also learning <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, and <b>Amazon Web Service</b>. 
			Creating and managing this personal website is a way to solidify my knowledges with them.
		</p>
		<p>
			As of now, I am really interested in <b>Big Data</b> and <b>Cloud Computing</b>. 
			The technologies I am learning right now will set up a good foundation in pursuing them.
			I am hoping to have internship or research opportunities related to these areas in the near future.
		</p>
		<p>
			For the rest of this website, I will present you my work experience and personal projects.
			Through this website, I hope I can introduce myself to you in a more comprehensive way, 
			and that you can know a little bit more about me.
			Lastly, please let me know if you have any more questions. My contact information is at the bottom.
		</p>
		<p>
			Thank you! <br/>
