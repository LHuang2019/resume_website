		<h1>Welcome!</h1>
		<p>
			Hi! my name is Li Jun Huang.
			I am a student Virginia Tech class of Spring 2019.
			I major in Computer Science and minor in Math and Cyber Security.
		</p>
		<p>
			I am most comfortable on <b>Java</b>, with working experience and school/personal projects.
			I have working/school experience with <b>C#</b>, <b>C</b> and <b>Puppet</b>, 
			not in-depth, but enough to pick them up quickly if necessary.
			I also have working experience on <b>Linux terminal</b>, specifically <b> RHEL </b>, 
			<b>OpenStack platform</b> for creating/managing servers, and <b>Git</b> for basic work flows.
		</p>
		<p>
			As of now, I am learning <b>Python</b>, <b>SQL</b> and <b>JavaScript</b>, 
			and am planning on to use them for future projects.
			I am also learning <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, and <b>Amazon Web Service</b>. 
			Creating and managing this website is an example.
		</p>
		<p>
			As of now, I am really interested in <b>Big Data</b> and <b>Cloud Computing</b>. 
			The technologies I am learning right now will set up a good foundation in pursuing these areas.
			I hope to have a internship or research opportunities related to these areas in the near future.
		</p>
		<p>
			For the rest of this website, I will present my working experience and personal projects.
			Through this website, I hope to introduce myself in a more comprehensive way beyond the resume.
			Lastly, please let me know if you have any questions about me. My contact information is at the bottom.

		<p>
			Thank you! <br/>
