		<h1>Welcome!</h1>
		<p>
			My name is Li Jun Huang.
			I am a student at Virginia Tech class of 2019.
			I major in Computer Science and minor in Math and Cyber Security.
		</p>
		<p>
			As of today, I am most comfortable on <b>Java</b>, with work experience and experience on school/personal projects.
			I have working/school experience on <b>C#</b>, <b>C</b> and <b>Puppet</b>, 
			not in-depth, but enough to pick them up quickly for a new task.
			I also have work experience on basic <b>Linux terminal</b> command prompt, specifically <b> RHEL </b>;
			on <b>OpenStack platform</b> for creating/managing servers; 
			and on <b>Git</b> for basic work tasks.
		</p>
		<p>
			I am currently learning <b>Python</b>, <b>SQL</b> and <b>JavaScript</b>, 
			and am planning on to use them for some future projects.
			I am also learning <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, and <b>Amazon Web Service</b>, 
			creating and managing this website is an example.
		</p>
		<p>
			I am really interested in <b>Big Data</b> and <b>Cloud Computing</b>. 
			The technologies I am learning right now will set up a good foundation in pursuing these interests.
			I hope to have an internship or research opportunity related to these areas in the future.
		</p>
		<p>
			Through this website, I hope to introduce myself in a more comprehensive way beyond the resume.
			Please let me know if you have any questions about me. My contact information is at the bottom.

			Thank you! <br/>
